We are reminded tonight by the overwhelming support of a fear- and hatemonger that, though we may be created equal, not everyone in this nation is granted the privilege of the same value or respect or security.
Like we do and our ancestors did, we will fight for that equality. We will fight for unity and for peace, so that nobody will fear for their lives and safety as a member of any minority group.
We shall persevere. We are not crushed. We have each other.
We will have the audacity to hope.

Thank you to all of the folks who've poured so much time and energy into the fight to #StopTrump and to build a system that works for #AllofUs. Let's keep breathing, fighting -- and make sure we take care of each other.

From a journalism and marketing perspective, it's been very interesting following the last three elections and seeing how the media, especially fake media has played a significant role in this one in particular.
Fake bots posting pro-Trump and Trump-related news outnumber similar accounts for Clinton by a landslide.
Facebook hasn't suppressed fake news sites from our feeds.
This election is especially unique because of the uprise of a war of the working class and the blatant racism seen here.
As someone who grew up in a low-income Hispanic household and worked for every single thing they've earned, I never even once put the blame on someone else. I never truly believed there was a single thing broken in our system.
Becoming an adult and experiencing life from a different angle in different industries, cities, and work environments has truly opened my eyes.
Seeing racism.
Seeing sexism.
Seeing classism.
It is very clear that here’s something dangerously broken with our establishment.
The reality is, each and everyone out there is strong enough to change that. To make a change.
Regardless of the outcome of tonight, there’s still so much to be done.
Speaking from experience, the best thing you can do to help your community, family, and friends thrive is through exchange of information and always being respectful.
Passing on the information you learned from a previous experience can be life changing. It doesn’t even have to be complicated. It can be by helping someone apply for a job.
And being nice is truly infectious.
XO

As a country, we were attacked on September 11th, 2001. I was a kid in elementary school, not understanding fully what was going on—there are blurry memories of watching Larry King on the classroom TV instead of having math, huddling together during recess, hearing my dad's voice over the telephone, saying he was grounded in LA because all flights were canceled. It took more than a decade for me to comprehend why this all happened.
Today, a much larger, silent force attacks this country—choking those who cried out when they experienced or saw injustice, gashing others who had the compassion to do something about it, stabbing all those who stood in the way of—their "ideal American Dream." And here I live and breathe and exist: fully conscious of every moment, literate and old enough to finally understand every news article, every statistic, every Tweet or Facebook status. Today I am watching things burst into flames once again. But where my childhood ignorance once shielded me from the pain—tonight, the horror of realizing that many, many humans chose to inflict suffering against others; this horror overcomes my body, my mind, and spirit. It's fucking painful.
I will become a casualty under this Trump presidency, and I pledge the next four years of my life to stand with the others who will bear the brunt of his whims and wraths. RESILIENCE

My parents are coming to get me, but I cannot guarantee my safety tonight. I really hope we pull through, but America has decisively voted against my identity as a queer person and as a sexual assault survivor (and, incidentally, against my career, as I am expected to sing for both inaugural prayer services), and I do not know how to address all those things.

It's not only because Hillary will lose that it hurts, it's because the world is fucking complicated and there is obviously a "right" and a "wrong" but we are all too short-sighted and misinformed for the greater cause, and we are biologically unable to overcome this.

2016: when Brock Turner, convicted rapist, served 3 months in jail; when America elected a rapist for President. As a woman--and I do not feel the same oppressions as other minorities--I understand my value to be zero. The value of POC/LGBTQ/Muslims is even lower, if that's even possible.

I AM SO ANGRY. This is what happens when the republicans choose the populist and the democrats choose an establishment elite in the moment of a crisis of legitimacy. Built off of 30 years of the GOP using race and gender to divide people against each other.
But it is time for us to come together and show deep compassion for all our brothers and sisters.

In the coming hours I'll feel great despair; a wrenching, then calmly sad dissociation from a vital part of my identity: what it means to be an American and to know America. I'll feel simple, raw anger. I'll feel that most desperate quiet-type of sadness that comes on the way to accepting an ongoing horror. In the following weeks we'll see statistical explanations for why the polls were wrong, we'll read Bernie hypotheticals and stern email FWDs from aunts, we'll drink too much. Later, when Bad Things happen, I believe that we'll respond with charity and conviction.
That's not enough. I was previously overwhelmed contemplating global warming, and we were ostensibly working to solve it then. Now? It's a Chinese hoax. Now, sexism and racism are being used to beat down the already oppressed, the most vulnerable, those we already owed reparations for systemic disadvantage. This is not new. Remember! The Racial Integrity Act of 1924 was overturned in 1967. Some women who voted today weren't born with that right. Obama finally apologized for genocide of Native peoples in 2010, as part of a defense appropriations bill, with legal indemnity.
It's not enough to respond to injustice. We need to seek justice, capital-J Justice, what Plato sought in Republic, the kind that he thought was Truth. We need the strength to imagine a better future. We need to invent new means of activism, new culture, new ways of living. Walter Benjamin imagined in Frankfurt, SDS imagined in Port Huron, Paris imagined in May '68, SNCC imagined on the Freedom Rides. "We live in capitalism, its power seems inescapable – but then, so did the divine right of kings," wrote Ursula K. LeGuin. "Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings.”

If you believe America is the greatest country in the world, wake up.
If you believe we live in a "post-racial world" wake up.
If you've been chanting "all lives matter" instead of standing up for your black friends and neighbors, wake up.
All of your points were just proved invalid. Wake the fuck up.
If this offends you, I don't care, because look where the fuck respectability politics has taken us.
Post script: if you voted for Trump, if anything about Trump's rhetoric DOESN'T terrify you, please by all means hit me with an unfriend.

I'm scrolling down the screens for information and I guess I'm crying a little but I don't really understand what's happening. There's a lot of numbers and pictures of crowds. Some infrastructure body that's part of me has expressed a choice, and that choice has something to do with the hatred shouted by the voice on the screens that's been growing louder and louder for months. I feel like I'm part of something that is turning against itself. It must be hurting a lot, to do that, and I wonder what I can do to make it hurt less. I check inside myself for the places where I love people and they're still there, which I take as a good sign though I still know that something is very wrong.

At 3am last night I stood in a friend's backyard, explaining to a friend who insisted I get over this, what being a woman has meant in my life. As he interrupted me and failed to understand my pain, a stranger opened their window and yelled down. Not to tell me to shut up for yelling at three in the morning. But to tell him to "shut up and let the woman speak".
To the more privileged folks:
First – You need to fucking listen. If you don't feel pain in your heart for the underprivileged surrounding you, take a minute and ask a woman about the last time her gender affected her life. The last time she was verbally or sexually assaulted. Ask a person of color, an immigrant, a gay person the last time they were in fear.
Second – We need to yell. Let other voices be heard, stand up for those that need our support and not allow hate and ignorance to run this fucking country.
I am so tired. But I will not allow any man to keep me from succeeding in every way I want to.

Thank you to my friends abroad who have reached out.
It is difficult to get up today, but we do so. I don't know how to live in a country under a man who has made people think misogyny, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, connery, sexual assault, and bullying someone for a disability are not just permissible mindsets and actions but are encouraged ones.
I think, due to some privilege of mine as an idealistic straight white liberal, I lost some innocence last night and my life has changed.
But I know the lives of millions of already exhausted and disillusioned Americans have lost more.
I won't pretend I am not terrified.
But as my friend Maija says, we stay for those who cannot leave. We're stronger together. So we move on, we fight, and we change this country.

I'm bisexual!
You may know this about me already. But for those of you who didn't, it's time you knew.
Yesterday, we elected to the highest offices of the United States two men with dangerous beliefs for many marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ individuals.
Our new president and vice president may not believe in my right to my identity or in your right to yours. But I do. And I hope that those of you reading this will continue to fight.
Being open about this part of my identity has always been extremely difficult for me. I hope that my honesty today is a first step towards resisting the hate-filled messages with which we've been inundated from our newly elected officials.
We live in a different America today than we did yesterday. That's just all the more reason to continue working hard to make sure that we live in the best America that we can, together, create.

I'm really not trying to see any white person on here talk about, "How could this happen!?"
Like, at all.
You know ALL of my posts challenging white privilege/white supremacy, racism, sexism, islamophobia that seem dramatic?
Every time I've said #BlackLivesMatter and someone said but ALL- or, worse BLUE-...
Every time I talk about a system being built against us and people not being educated properly, on purpose?
Every time I wear my, "'Nah' -Rosa Parks" shirt...
Every time I quote someone other than the precious MLK?
Every time I defended Beyoncé and Kaepernick?
Every time I shared a video of the "Great" times Trump would like to revert to?
Every time I tried to explain the misrepresentation in the media?
Every time I mentioned not feeling compelled to vote for Hillary is a privilege?
Or, even better, how I mentioned the disdain America would have for a leader with a vagina?
Every time I told you they're killing us and others said, "Yeah, but..."
Every time I, or any PoC spoke and you took it with a grain of salt?
(s/n: obviously not a message for the people who engaged in a positive discussion with me, they know how this could happen)
We try. DAILY. On here to educate everyone properly on the effects of white supremacy, from micro-aggressions to racism...
so don't ask? "How could this happen!?" when I have used up all the heart I have in me to explain it to you over the years.

It took me longer than usual to get ready for work today. I didn’t feel like facing the world, I didn’t feel like going in to the office – I felt like, what’s the point anyway? Then I thought about my to-do list for today. I’m going to design a small advertising campaign that promotes free webinars produced by the Association for Library Service to Children. The webinars are on a variety of topics; the last one was called “Whitewashing, Sexism, and More: Using Book Covers to Start a Conversation with Kids,” and there’s an upcoming series on early literacy.
It’s a small comfort, but I thought about how if I’m good at my job today, maybe one more librarian will learn about this free offering, or decide to finally attend one. Maybe that librarian will be inspired to make great programming for toddlers, and maybe a two-year-old in that library will grow up to love reading because of it, and will read broadly and voraciously as a teenager and an adult. Maybe the books that person reads will allow them to move through the world with increased empathy, perspective, and understanding. It can be hard to do work that plays the long game like this when so much needs fixing TODAY, but I think it’s worthwhile.
I’m looking to be inspired today: is anyone else doing things, through their job or through other efforts, that will make a positive impact?

America, you have failed.
This country, that isn't even in the Top 10 for education, has proven to the rest the world exactly why they DON'T belong there. You taught us that we have freedom, are protected, and we DO matter in this huge "accepting, melting pot" of a country. But today, this is not the country I grew to know and on most days, love. I am left feeling nothing but terrified, sick, and in disbelief.
This is the United States of America - "United we stand, divided we fall."
But now, I do not stand with you, America. You have failed me as a woman, person of color, and downright just as a person. So here's to the start of our fall.

To say that I'm scared right now is honestly an understatement. Not only is putting a man like Donald Trump in charge of the country a threat to people politically but one of the scarier less talked about parts is how it effects us as a culture. The fact that a terrible man used fear and hate to become president and succeeded is seen as a validation to the hate to his supporters. The same group of people who chanted "build the wall" on the bus I was on or the peoole who think it's acceptable to discriminate against Muslims won and now we have to deal with those ramifications. It honestly blows my mind that anyone can vote for that man but here we are. If anyone needs a shoulder to cry on or someone to talk to I am always available.
P.s. if you are reading this and thinking "it's just the election, it's no big deal" your white privilege is part of the problem.

Recently, I saw Zizek's video in which he stated he would vote Trump to bring closer the revolution. I was revulsed and saddened to see how the utopia of revolution benights the obvious danger of electing someone so shamelessly unpredictable and anti-people.
Today creates a sense of intellectual urgency and calls for responsibility, calls for organic work, for study, for understanding, for leaving the blue comfort bubble of apparent isolations from people's hearts.
Today brings in the questions: What are the social and cultural circumstances that make Donald Trump electable (soon to become elected)? How can we learn, educate, persuade people to make better choices for themselves in future?
I do not want to mourn India, Hungary, Brexit, vote no, Law and Justice, Hong Kong and Trump, I want to understand their conditions of possibility and work every day to change them, to be more persuasive that open, multicultural, civic-minded society is possible and better. Historical contingency scares but potentiates the world for different future and let's work for the subjunctive currently unavailable but definitely possible.

In trying to make sense over the election outcome I'm trying to figure out why things played out as they did. My gut feeling is this: Most of the American electorate is just plain angry at a political system that is leaving them and their interests behind… and they want change. Both candidates are extremely disliked but Hillary represents the status quo while Trump is an outsider… and apparently America is willing to try the outsider even though he’s so disliked. It seems like this is a vote against our current political system rather than an endorsement of Trump, who, by the way, did not win the popular vote… that went to Hillary.
The question now is, where do we go from here?

The outcome was exactly what many of us didn't want, but we can't waste time aggressively blaming others. For the moment, it's over, and we need each other now more than ever. After this last year and a half of open hate and vitriol, it's not going to get better, and there will be a major lack of safety for some groups, so what we must do is stand at the ready for those who need it the most.
We can still strive for what we were inspired to, by the people who brought us out in force, when the idea of this new presidency was still just an absurdity to many of us.
Maybe I am being too positive, too early, but I don't want to accept that we all are powerless after last night.

We were very lucky to grow up with the Obama era in high school and college. We were lucky to see a world where a woman from our high school, already accomplished on her own, could move people with her words and remind us that when they go low, we go high. The Obamas truly gave me hope that life could be different and positive, that my skin color and gender, aspects about myself that I love, wouldn't hinder my ability to achieve. In fact, they would bring new light to my achievements, and perhaps inspire others the way the Obamas have inspired me.
The America I know and live every day is one of diversity, of LGBT love, of acceptance and kindness. Maybe today doesn't reflect that idea I have of America, but I'm willing to fight for that America I call home. I'm not hugely into politics, nor would I ever make a good politician...so I will fight for that America using the craft I honed for years and years: art.
I love you all, and I want to make things better. I want to make art that will give voices to those who feel stifled right now. I want to show people there is still love in all of this hatred. So I wanted to tell you I love you, no matter what you believe in, and I hope you share some of that love with the others around you.

To everyone feeling scared, disempowered, and straight-up insulted by this: I love you and I’m here for you.
I feel those things, too. As a woman, as the sister of someone with special needs, as a person who values compassion over hate. But I know so many people who feel more directly threatened than I do right now. I’m lucky enough to be surrounded every day by people of color, people who were not born in this country, Muslim people, queer people, people with disabilities. People who make me see beyond myself.
So this is my promise not just to stand with you, but to fight with you, even though none of us should need to fight. This is my promise to do more. We still have strength, love, and the power to support each other every single day, and that’s not going anywhere. And if anyone needs someone to talk to, I’m here.

This year I have been talking to many of my NYC-based artist friends (American and foreign) about what it means to be an artist and how to go about making it in the world. During this election cycle, I have heard many of these same people say things like " I don't know anyone voting for Trump" or ask questions like "Who are these people supporting him?" In fact there have been times I have momentarily had the same thoughts...
Believe it or not these two things are connected. We get to sit at a coffee shop or bar in NYC talking art, criticizing the art world and then hatching plans to "succeed in" or "subvert" it all while being stroked by the soothing comfort of living in one of the ONLY places in America where most people agree with us.
We balk at museums/galleries that don't show enough female or POC artists but still go to them, work in them, and try to show in them (me included here). We applaud symbols of action by artists, rarely asking them or ourselves to do more.
We sit around talking about how hard it is to live in NYC but then justify it by saying it's the only place that's relevant in the US for pushing our practice. I think it's become obvious today that this is an illusion we create that allows us to avoid the real spaces of tension and conflict that could indeed push our work in meaningful ways.
This isn't a critique of others, this is me acknowledging and seeing just how willing I was to leave my previous homes of KY and Chicago behind- those communities are more complicated and required more of me. But I, like so many of you, wanted to find a place where I thought I belonged.... and for the last 6 years NYC has been that.... but it's also lulled me into a false sense of security.
So many posts today about action and love. I challenge myself and all you fighters and lovers to think about WHERE you need to be fighting and loving to heal this nation.

As I sit at my desk, dumbfounded by the results of this election…I am also humbled. I am thankful to be in a school and have a student teaching caseload where there is an abundance of culture, children of color, children of different religions and children of LGBTQ+ families. I am forever grateful for this community. This is the community that I grew up in. Bay Shore has shaped me into the person I am today along with my supporting and loving parents and family. If only the entire nation could see what a community like mine can accomplish. What I have learned from being in this community is that togetherness is what makes us thrive. Diversity is the key to this community’s success. I have also grown to know that communities like mine, are RESILIENT. We are PROUD. We are STRONG. I will never stop holding my girlfriends hand and she will never stop serving in the NYPD with the utmost respect for all people regardless of who is in office. I will never stop being a proud member of the Jewish community and LGBTQ+ community. I will never back down when fighting for my Black and Muslim sisters and brothers. I will never stop dedicating my career to individuals with special needs. We may have lost this election but we will NEVER lose the foundation of who we are. For those of you who feel unsafe, unheard and uneasy, I understand and I am so sorry; My family and I feel it too. However, we are fighters. We are part of the greater cause and the greater good and that has to mean something. We are the face of what this country was meant to be and that will not be lost. We will overcome and we will not hide. We will be seen now more than ever.

today begins the anniversary of kristallnacht, the two day period where Nazis pillaged the homes and temples of Ashkenazi jewish communities throughout Germany and killed almost 100 innocent people in cold blood
after he won an election that spurred the burning of black churches, and as we organize to protect muslim places of worship and latinx families and homes, this juxtaposition of time jarringly reminds me how often bad people destroy beautiful things out of hatred and spite.

The worst part of this election for me is the fact that I have white relatives that are excited for a Trump presidency. The fact that I have Uncles and Cousins who think Donald Trump would be great. Having racist "friends" and acquaintances is one thing but to see that members of your family clearly don't value your life or your safety is another. The biggest struggle I find with being half black is dealing with racism in my own family.

See what this shit does? Puts us against one another, has us arguing and belittling each other's opinions like never before. We are slaves to the bullshit that we have been chained to. I'm sick and tired of seeing hate spouting out of everyone just to try to prove to somebody else that their opinion is the correct one. It seems as if all of this has been purely designed to create separation and hatred amongst the human race. They know that there is strength is numbers- if we took a stand on our beliefs as a WHOLE, we would win, however they have won because they have successfully segregated us and boxed us in. They are triumphant because society is unfortunately maluable, complacent and or misinformed. Let's do better, not just as Americans but as humans.

So much post election discussion right now is centered on the plight of economically disenfranchised rural whites, but we can't for a second pretend that Trump's election is purely a result of rural economic issues.
Just a quick look at the exit polls should be enough to dispel that myth. White people of all income brackets came out on election day to vote for trump. In the primaries over half of his supporters had an income over 72k.
Donald Trump may be selling economic stability to rural areas (i.e. pretending to give a shit about dead and dying industries), but his win isn't about oil and coal. (as if that could even justify electing someone openly racist and sexist and generally despicable) Donald Trump rose to the presidency selling fear and hatred to white people of all incomes everywhere.
We need to stop buying.

Friends - it's time to show up for each other now. If you were waiting for the right moment, this is it. We have a long fight ahead of us, and I am scared.
I'm alarmed by how much I see people playing the blame game. While it is worthwhile to analyze what happened, we cannot let this election divide us. There is a storm coming, and we are not prepared.
The one thing that gives me hope this morning is the incredible number of people I see posting on facebook out of rage, fear, shock, confusion about "what we do now." Organizers who are beginning to talk strategy - yes, but also folks who are engaging for the first time and understand that the stakes are now way too high to sit this out.
In the coming four years we need to be ready to throw down, strategize, organize, hold each other close. Movements have the power to fight back, to rise up and protect immigrants, Muslims, women, LGBTQ folk, people of color who will be targeted. The road we're headed down is ugly, we cannot let the coming struggle split us apart. We are powerful, we are many, our movements will grow stronger and louder to meet this.
Let's love each other hard now. Take care. Protect each other. Here we go.

Friends who are frustrated, I feel you - so am I. I've cried three times today, each time related to the lesson we're teaching those who have shown support for our new president, not in spite of his racism, sexism and hate speech but because of it. I am a minority and today I feel like one.
That said, I urge you to not shut these oppressive voices out of your life, virtually or otherwise. Lack of connectivity is how we got here; community is essential and it does not happen by shaming or segregating. 'Send Message' is a far more difficult button to press than 'Delete Friend' but ultimately more productive. I get it, I have done it, and I will continue to smash the like on all posts that align with my opinions but I am not going to ignore the ones that don't. We're all on this dance floor together, we need to make room.

WE NEED ELECTION REFORM
My timeline makes it clear to me that the people I surround myself with were on the RIGHT side of history last night. In better words than I can, they have expressed the need to stand with minorities and historically oppressed groups in America during this difficult time,
All day I have been thinking about how much fundamental changes to the American voting system are desperately needed.
Why?
 - because Hilary WON the POPULAR vote but lost the election. The electoral college system is BULLSHIT. Why are we still using this outdated and irrelevant system that was created by white men to placate slave states and keep themselves in power. the system has shown AGAIN that it does not guarantee that EVERY vote by EVERY American in EVERY state is given equal weight. Smaller states with smaller minority populations are given disproportionate electoral votes per person while more densely populated urban states are stripped of any real decision making.
 -because Black Men have been strategically disenfranchised through the criminal justice system. (for more read New Jim Crow or watch 13th)
 - because it is not a public holiday when the whole nation votes for their president. yet we have Columbus day?? NEED I SAY MORE.
 - because the default voting form is in person at a polling station.. which obviously disproportionally affects low-income groups, people in poor health, people with disabilities, people with young children, people with inflexible work hours etc…. how is this still a thing? WHY ARE WE NOT USING TECHNOLOGY.
 - because it takes weeks to register. Why can we not register online and vote on the same day?
 - because there are still voter ID laws which are an obstacle to participation that disproportionately affects marginalized groups.
WE NEED ELECTION REFORM AND WE NEED IT NOW>

Taking a little break from social media to gather some thoughts and figure out where I am right now.
I expect in the coming weeks the liberal community will start to divide. Critiquing each other for not fighting enough. Labeling each other hypocrites or slacktivists. Accusing each other of not truly understanding what is at stake.
Yes we need to rally, yes we need to encourage each other, but let's also be patient with each other. We need to unify, which means listening and respecting each other. Please remember that everyone has their own way of processing, grieving, healing, and then fighting the fight.

One Weird Thing I've been really antsy about this whole year is how much click/view maximization, the dominant incentive of many media platforms, has twisted national discourse.
This is the first election where I have really wanted to learn more about politics, and it has been frustrating and confusing how many news outlets and channels have preferred framing the election as a reality show over talking about how changes to our country's infrastructure would impact people. There's some excellent long-form journalism out there, but it doesn't have the plague-like reshare power of clickbait. National newscasts this year spent ~3x as much time making references to email servers (which Clinton is far from alone in using) as they did discussing all other election-related policy issues COMBINED.
Some thoughts: many questions, few answers. Are there conditions where quality journalism can dominate shock value as an incentive? What makes people vulnerable to fearmongering (and can they be made less vulnerable in those conditions)? Apps and web products invest a lot of effort into reward-hacking our brains, and have us all consuming ultra-personalized, filtered information that makes it difficult to find out about other viewpoints — how can this change at a noticeable scale? How can we get a better understanding of the rest of our country?

Now is not the time to be silent. Now is not the time to sit back and assume things won't be as bad as they seem. The grief that I feel, that my friends and loved ones feel, is very real. So let's talk about white supremacy. Let's talk about Islamophobia. Let's talk about capitalism, queerphobia, transphobia, classism, ableism. And then let's act.

It’s Our First 100 Days
Yesterday's election was testament to the fact that our country is more deeply divided than many of us thought possible. These divides call into question our fundamental commitment to democracy, as witnessed by the Senate block on the confirmation of Judge Garland to the Supreme Court. Our country's divides also question our ideals of opportunity, as witnessed by popular support of Mr. Trump's plans to expunge many of our country's immigrants and to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. The huge amount of uncertainty that this election raises is already carrying severe consequences for the global economy, with implications for the well being of Americans and that of people around the globe.
What matters most right now is not what Mr. Trump does in his first 100 days, but what we as Americans do in our next 100. What matters is what beliefs and commitments we take a stand for at this moment -- and insist that our elected officials uphold as well. This must involve upholding the democratic process with regard to the Supreme Court, the Affordable Care Act, our treatment of all people contributing to our country's economy, our commitment to gender equality, and the way we treat our environment. We must insist on concrete plans for moving forward the kind of democracy we believe in, rather than being paralyzed by threats about what will be torn down. We must also keep focus on what's happening directly around us -- in our communities and our states -- and recognize that we have agency at these levels, too, and the time to take action is now.

Hey friends, if you frustrated by the election and not sure how to make a difference - if you want to share a skill or teach a workshop please contact me and i'll help you set up something. Education, sharing knowledge, experience and opinions is transformative to both teachers and students.
It's ok if you've never done it before - it's ok if you don't think you know enough about a subject to 'teach' it. There's no better way to learn something then to teach it and try to explain it to others in ways that resonates with their experiences.
Knowledge isn't something bestowed on us by institutions, it's a gift we can give each other. Get at me.

I haven't been quick to talk about this election and I think the reason for that is because through these first few years of learning about systematic oppression, I've learned not to underestimate white supremacy. It's certainly showing us it at its worst with the recent hate crimes occurring in the wake of this election, but it's come up many times in my life before that. What history I was taught in school, conversations as a child on how to deal with police from my parents, and being told in college that "change takes time" while no real solutions were offered while acts of hate were occurring on campus, are some examples that come in mind.
The terror, the tears, the uncertainty, the feeling of a lost sense of safety for yourselves and your loved ones that I see a lot of people are feeling right now are all too familiar to me and to that long list of groups that are in many of your statuses. Especially for those who are a part of many of those groups. Maybe that's why I haven't seemed too upset or had said anything until now. For me, and many of my siblings, oppression is something that we have endured through every administration before Trump and will continue to do the same long after he leaves office. I do not offer this to say that we've been through worse, this is by far the largest and the most tragic display of every possible -ism and -phobia. I am thinking of all of my siblings, especially those in marginalized communities that are routinely forgotten about or looked over to begin with. This is tough, unprecedented, and I know it's a lot for many of us. I hope we are all able to find the time and space to heal during this time and long after it.
To those that are experiencing this for the first time (or, I think more accurately, at a much higher level of immediacy for the first time) I say, welcome. My aim is not to belittle how you feel. I try not to use the tools of my oppressors to then build with. But I am reminded here of what my mother has been instilling in me all my life. Do what y'all have to do to get through this because there is still much work to be done.

Fuck doubts! If you're feeling doubtful let it all out at once. Vocalize your doubts in an absurd stream to those around you or the room you are in and you will realize how much your own mind is mocking you. Be not the joke but the clown, then there is never a false step.

Everyone blaming everyone else, as if anyone has the answers. It's exhausting. Don't forget everyone here is human, all trying to grasp that the world is not what some of us hoped it could be.
I went to a buddhist meditation center today to try and step away for a second and breathe. I was reminded we can only really change ourselves.
Would be lovely if we could all stop telling each other how to see it, what the truths are when there are none, or your truth is yours but it's not mine. We're going to need our sanity most of all if we're gonna get through any of this. And we'll probably need each other to maintain that sanity to some extent.
Being human is not easy. We all do what we can but still it is hard, painful even. The mind plays tricks. We're emotional, vulnerable, fragile, and that's on a good day! Please don't forget that part, the human part.

There are many different types of people who voted for Trump, some of whom are your family, friends, or acquaintances. Instead of cutting them out of your life, or avoiding an awkward conversation, I urge you to talk to them, and explain that if they don't identify with the same hatred as other Trump voters, it's their responsibility to do everything they can to defend against the actions of those that do.

My grandma told me that on Thursday she saw a lot of white people crying because they did not understand (referring to election). She said she felt bad for them. And I said grandma, I can't today. They will be okay and can seek understanding. But ultimately, this country lacks courage right now and crying is just not enough. She's an interesting lady my grandma.

Just to be clear Trump is not the problem... White supremacy, and it's cohorts, internalized homophobia, xenophobia and misogyny, is the problem. Trump is a symptom. We need to do the work accordingly.

In the past few days, president elect Trump has ignored hate speech and attacks, worked to undermine protestors and the media, and clearly stated his intentions for mass deportations. Meanwhile, he's appeased the republican establishment by selecting a group that will likely push for a return to disastrous Bush-era policies. A lot of business leaders have issued warm welcomes to Trump, probably hoping for a chance to "cash out" in tax cuts that will mostly benefit corporations and the wealthy. I think it's time to get obsessed with politics, if you aren't already, and figure out how we can quickly prevent the bad things from happening, and get behind the good things. What leaders will we rally behind? How can we use the legal system? How can we accomplish things outside the law? How can we use the Internet? How can we use international pressure? What's our economic plan? How can we win in 2018? How can we convince people that Trump is not the way? What's the better way?

Among many other important questions this election cycle, I want to know how having major publications like the NYtimes/Fivethirtyeight showing Clinton with a 92%/76%/etc. chance influenced the election. I want the punditry class to admit that they have no idea what they are talking about when they throw around polls and data. I want the media to take concrete steps to correct their current model of hyped "data journalism" and punditry for punditry's sake.
In an election that mass media made into a spectacle that was defined not by policy but by the candidates media performance (tone/volume/posture/hand gestures/facial control), there was a perverse pleasure in hearing the flutter of panic in John King's voice on election night. It was the quaver of uncertainty as his usually steady hands frantically searched for another tenth of a percentage point; his booming voice resigned to almost a whisper. This uncertainty was for, if not for the future of the country, his own culpability in Hillary's defeat as a member of the punditry class. On election night, I watched this widely-respected universally-liked "neutral" pundit, this modern day cartographer, as his fingertips traversed an unfamiliar red geography, grasping for what the Data had surely promised--it was the only thing close to satisfaction that night. Trump winning shouldn't be a surprise to the journalists and pundits that covered this election like a reality tv show, when everyone knows that the star is always the Villain.
