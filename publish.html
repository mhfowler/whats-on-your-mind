    My parents are coming to get me, but I cannot guarantee my safety tonight. I really hope we pull through, but America has decisively voted against my identity as a queer person and as a sexual assault survivor (and, incidentally, against my career, as I am expected to sign for both inaugural prayer services), and I do not know how to address all those things.

    I’m really not trying to see any white person on here talk about, “How could this happen!?”
    <br><br>
    Like at all.
    <br><br>
    You know ALL of my posts challenging white privilege/white supremacy, racism, sexism, islamophobia that seem dramatic?
    <br><br>
    Every time I’ve said #BlackLivesMatter and someone has said but ALL - or, worse BLUE-…
    <br><br>
    Every time I talk about a system being built against us and people not being educated properly on purpose?
    <br><br>
    Every time I wear my, “Nah’ -Rosa Parks” shirt…
    <br><br>
    Every time I quote someone other than the precious MLK?
    <br><br>
    Every time I defended Beyonce and Kaepernick?
    <br><br>
    Every time I shared a video of the “Great” times Trump would like to revert to?
    <br><br>
    Every time I tried to explain the misrepresentation in the media?
    <br><br>
    Every time I mentioned not feeling compelled to vote for Hillary is a privilege?
    <br><br>
    Or, even better, how I mentioned the disdain America would have for a leader with a vagina?
    <br><br>
    Every time I told you they’re killing us and others  said, “Yeah, but…”
    <br><br>
    Every time I, or an PoC spoke and you took it with a grain of salt? (s/n: obviously not a message for the people who engaged in positive discussion with me, they know how this could happen)
    <br><br>
    We try. DAILY. On here to educate everyone properly on the effects of white supremacy from micro-aggressions to racism…
    <br><br>
    so don’t ask? “How could this happen!?” when I have used up all the heart I have in me to explain it to you over the years.

    We deserve so much better. For all the women. For all communities of color. For all immigrants. For all queer folks. For all poor people.<br>
    —<br>
    I AM SO ANGRY. This is what happens when the republicans choose the populist and the democrats choose an establishment elite in the moment of a crisis of legitimacy. Built off of 30 years of the GOP using race and gender to divide people against each other.
    <br><br>
    But it is time for us to come together and show deep compassion for all our brothers and sisters.
